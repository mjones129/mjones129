# Howdy! I'm Matt

I'm a full stack developer with 5 years experience working on custom WordPress themes and plugins. Heavy terminal usage with over 6 years of experience in Linux. Obsessed with automation. Always willing to put the work in up front to build systems and processes that make devs lives easier in the future.
