# Howdy! I'm Matt

I'm a full stack developer with 5 years experience working on custom WordPress themes and plugins. Heavy terminal usage with over 6 years of experience in Linux. Obsessed with automation. Always willing to put the work in up front to build systems and processes that make devs lives easier in the future.

## Some tools and plugins I've built

📦 A Bash script that migrates/backs up WordPress sites hosted on any Ubuntu-based VPS to virtually any cloud storage solution every 24 hours. It also deletes remote backups older than so many days before uploading a new backup for the day. Backups can easily be "restored" to any environment (local, production, staging) with a restoration script.
